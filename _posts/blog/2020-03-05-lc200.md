# Leetcode 200. Number of Islands (Python)

# Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Depth-First-Search" target="_blank"> Depth-First-Search</a>.

# Description
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.


## Sample I/O
### Example 1
```
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1

```

### Example 2
```
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```

## Note:
* 1 <= d, f <= 30
* 1 <= target <= 1000

# Methodology
This question can be solved by Depth First Search and it is very classic DFS question for list.

To find the number of islands, we need to move from left top to bottom right. For each move we can go up or right or down or left directions. After each move, if we are out of the bondary or we find water or we repeat the path then we return to last move and change to another direction to move until we find 1 island. After we find island, we update the count and start to find another island.

# Code
```python
def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid: return 0
        row = len(grid)
        col = len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        count = 0
        def findIsland(r,c):
            if row-1<r<0 or col-1<c<0 or grid[r][c]=='0' or (r,c) in visited:
                return
            visited.add((r,c))
            if 0<=r-1:#up
                findIsland(r-1,c)
            if c+1<=col-1:#right
                findIsland(r,c+1)
            if r+1<=row-1:#down
                findIsland(r+1,c)
            if c-1>=0:#left
                findIsland(r,c-1)
            return
            
        for r in range(row):
            for c in range(col):
                if grid[r][c] == '1' and (r,c) not in visited:
                    count +=1
                    findIsland(r,c)         
        return count
```
# BigO
We iterate each cell will cost O(m\*n) where m\*n is the size of the 2D list.
