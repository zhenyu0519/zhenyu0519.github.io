# 739. Daily Temperatures (Python)

## Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Stack" target="_blank"> Stack</a>.

## Description
Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

## Methodology
This is straight forward question. We use stack to append and pop.

```python
def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        if not T: return []
        res = [0] * len(T)
        stack = []
        for index, val in enumerate(T):
            while stack and stack[-1][0] < val:
                stack_top_index = stack.pop()[1]
                count = index - stack_top_index
                res[stack_top_index]=count
            stack.append((val, index))
        return res
```
# BigO
Iterate the T once will take O(n) and the worst case will be roughly O(2n)
