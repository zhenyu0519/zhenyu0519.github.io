# 1197. Minimum Knight Moves (Python)

## Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Breadth-First-Search" target="_blank"> Breadth-First-Search</a>.

## Description
In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].

![knight](/images/blog/knight.png)

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y].  It is guaranteed the answer exists.

## Sample I/O

### Example 1

```
Input: x = 2, y = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: x = 5, y = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]
```

## Note
* |x| + |y| <= 300

## Methodology
A similar question with the number of islands. Use BFS to expand the area from init point in coordinate to 8 directions. Keep tracking currentX, currentY and steps. Once the (currentX, currentY) is equal to target coordinate return steps.

``` python
def minKnightMoves(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        # 8 directions
        directions = {(2,1),(2,-1),(-2,1),(-2,-1),(1,2),(1,-2),(-1,2),(-1,-2)}
        queue = collections.deque()
        visited = set()
        x,y = abs(x), abs(y)
        if x == 1 and y == 1: return 2
        # (x,y,steps)
        queue=deque([(0,0,0)])
        while queue:
            cur_x,cur_y,steps=queue.popleft()
            if [cur_x,cur_y]==[x,y]: return steps
            
            for dx, dy in directions:
                if 0<=cur_x+dx<=300 and 0<=cur_y+dy<=300 and (cur_x+dx,cur_y+dy) not in visited:
                    visited.add((cur_x+dx,cur_y+dy))
                    queue.append((cur_x+dx,cur_y+dy,steps+1))
```

# BigO
Time complexity : O(m*n) where m is the row of the chessboard and n is column of the chessboard.
