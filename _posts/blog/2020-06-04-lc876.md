# 876. Middle of the Linked List (Python)

# Description
Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Sample I/O

### Example 1
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

## Note
The number of nodes in the given list will be between 1 and 100.

# Methodology
The straight forward solution is iterate the linked list to get the size, then calculate the middle point of the size if the size . After that, we iterate the linked list again and stop at the middle point and return it.

A better solution will be using fast and slow pointers, we create two pointers called slow and fast, for each move the fast pointer will go 2 steps and the slow pointer will go 1 step, the iteration will stop until the fast pointer reach to the end then the slow pointer is pointing the node that we want to return.

# Code (straight forward solution)
```python
    def middleNode(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow
```
# BigO
Iterate the linked list once, so total time complexity is O(n)
