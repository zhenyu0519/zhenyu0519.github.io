# Leetcode 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree (Python)

# Description
We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an integer value K.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.

## Sample I/O

### Example 1
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2

Output: [7,4,1]

Explanation: 
The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
have values 7, 4, and 1.
```

```
Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.
```

## Note

* The given tree is non-empty.
* Each node in the tree has unique values 0 <= node.val <= 500.
* The target node is a node in the tree.
* 0 <= K <= 1000.

# Methodology
First use DFS to construct a graph like dictionary and then use BFS to iterate K levels start from the target point.

# Code(DFS)
```python
def distanceK(self, root, target, K):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type target: TreeNode
        :type K: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        def dfs(parent,child):
            if child is None: return
            if parent and child:
                graph[child.val].append(parent.val)
                graph[parent.val].append(child.val)
            dfs(child, child.left)
            dfs(child, child.right)
            return
        
        dfs(None,root)
        
        queue = collections.deque([target.val])
        visited=set()
        visited.add(target.val)
        while K:
            for i in range(len(queue)):
                parent=queue.popleft()
                visited.add(parent)
                for child in graph[parent]:
                    if child not in visited:
                        queue.append(child)
            K-=1
        return list(queue)
```
# BigO
We use DFS to construct the graph like dictionary will take O(n) and use BFS to iterate k level which will take less than O(n) in total the time complexity is roughly O(n)
