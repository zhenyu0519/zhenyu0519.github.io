# 347. Top K Frequent Elements (Python)

## Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Heap" target="_blank"> Heap</a>.

## Description
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

## Sample I/O

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```
## Note
* You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
* Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
* It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top k frequent elements is unique.
* You can return the answer in any order.

## Methodology
First we need count the appearence for each element store it in dictionary. Then we iterate the dictionary, and push the value-key pair (or count-value pair) into heap, if the the heap length less than k. When heap length is greater or equal than k, we push the current value-key pair into heap and pop one from the heap in order to keep the length of the heap equal to key. After iteration, we will get the k most frequent elements pair, we only need to return the value not the count.

``` python
def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        res=[]
        dict = collections.Counter(nums)
        for val, count in dict.items():
            if len(res)<k:
                heapq.heappush(res,(count,val))
            else:
                heapq.heappush(res,(count,val))
                heapq.heappop(res)
        return [val for count, val in res]
```

# BigO
Time complexity : O(n+m+k) which n is the size of input, m is the size of the dictionary and k is given.
