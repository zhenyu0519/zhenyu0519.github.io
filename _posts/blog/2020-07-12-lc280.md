# 280. Wiggle Sort (Python)

## Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Array" target="_blank"> Array</a>.

## Description
Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it in-place such that nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]....

## Sample I/O

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [3,5,2,1,6,4]
Output: One possible answer is [3,5,1,6,2,4]
```

## Methodology
Create a flag to indicate the condition is cur >= next or cur <= next. Iterate the given input, if the condition suppose to be cur >= next but cur <= next then swap the cur and next; if the condition suppose to be cur <= next but cur >= next then swap the cur and next. For each iteration, the flag need to flip.

Another solution is sort the given input first. Then swap two adjacent elements based on the index. This gives O(n) time complexity as well. 

``` python
def wiggleSort(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        greater = False
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if (greater and nums[i]<=nums[i+1]) or (not greater and nums[i]>=nums[i+1]):
                nums[i],nums[i+1]=nums[i+1],nums[i]
            greater = not greater
```

# BigO
Time complexity : O(n) where n is the size of input.
