# Leetcode 339. Nested List Weight Sum (Python)

# Related Topic

# Description

Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

## Sample I/O

### Example 1
```
Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 10 
Explanation: Four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 27 
Explanation: One 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27.
```

# Methodology
This question can be solved by Depth First Search.

Weight sum is level depth times sum. We will go throught the list, if the element is digit, we sum up. If element is list, we use dfs to get into new depth and go through the new list again. The depth is start from 1.

# Code
```python
def depthSum(self, nestedList: List[NestedInteger]) -> int:      
        def DFS(nestedList, depth):
            temp_sum = 0
            for elem in nestedList:
                if elem.isInteger():
                    temp_sum += elem.getInteger() * depth
                else:
                    temp_sum += DFS(elem.getList(),depth+1)
            return temp_sum
        return DFS(nestedList,1)
```
# BigO
We traversal all elements of nested list so total time complexity is O(n)
