# 429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal (Python)

# Related Topic

# Description
Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

## Sample I/O

### Example 1
![orange](/images/blog/narytreeexample.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [[1],[3,2,4],[5,6]]
```

### Example 2
![orange](/images/blog/sample_4_964.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [[1],[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13],[14]]
```

## Note
* The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
* The total number of nodes is between [0, 10^4].

# Methodology
This question is similart with question <a href="/2020/03/26/lc559/" target="_blank"> 559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree (Python) </a> but this time we are going to get print nodes by level.

We need tmp list to append each level node's then append the tmp list to final result list.


# Code (BFS)
```python
def levelOrder(self, root: 'Node') -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root: return []
        q = collections.deque([root])
        res = []
        while q:
            temp = []
            size = len(q)
            for i in range(size):
                node = q.popleft()
                temp.append(node.val)
                for child in node.children:
                    q.append(child)
            res.append(temp)
        return res
```
# BigO
We traversal all elements of tree once so total time complexity is O(n) where is the size of the tree
