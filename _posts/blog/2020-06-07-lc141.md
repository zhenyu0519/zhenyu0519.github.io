# 141. Linked List Cycle (Python)

## Description
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

## Sample I/O

### Example 1
![example1](/images/blog/circularlinkedlist.png)
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

### Example 2
![example1](/images/blog/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

### Example 3
![example1](/images/blog/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## Follow Up
Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

## Methodology
Set fast and slow pointers on the linked list, fast pointer will move to step each time while the slow pointer will only move 1 step. If there is loop, then fast and slow pointers will finally be coincided. 

## Code
```python
def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        fast, slow = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast, slow = fast.next.next, slow.next
            if fast == slow:
                return True
        return False
```
# BigO
Iterate the both linked lists once, so total time complexity is O(m+n) where m steps of fast pointer and n is steps of slow pointer
