# 973. K Closest Points to Origin (Python)

## Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Heap" target="_blank"> Heap</a>.

## Description
We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

## Sample I/O

### Example 1

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```

## Note
* 1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000
* -10000 < points[i][0] < 10000
* -10000 < points[i][1] < 10000

## Methodology
Use max heap to maintain the first Kth largest pair. The largest pair is calculated as sqrt(x\*x+y\*y). However you don't need to calculate sqrt, this won't affect the result and save a little time.

``` python
def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        heap = []
        for x,y in points:
            if len(heap)<K:
                heapq.heappush(heap,[-(x*x+y*y),[x,y]])
            else:
                heapq.heappushpop(heap,[-(x*x+y*y),[x,y]])
        return [pair for value, pair in heap]
```
