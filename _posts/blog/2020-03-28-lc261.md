# 261. Graph Valid Tree (Python)

# Related Topic

# Description
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.


## Sample I/O

### Example 1
```
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]
Output: true
```

### Example 2
```
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [1,4]]
Output: false
```

## Note
you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0,1] is the same as [1,0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

# Methodology
This question is similart with question <a href="/2020/03/27/lc323/" target="_blank"> 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph </a>
For this question, 
* As a tree, the the number of edges must equal to the number of nodes - 1.
* If the given input can build up one valid tree, then there should be only one complete graph which include all nodes.

If the number of edges is the number of nodes - 1, we use BFS start from a certain node and find all related to this node and append them to the visited set. If the final size of the visited set is not equal to the number of nodes. That means there are more than 1 graph can be built by given input. Which is False

# Code (BFS)
```python
def validTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        if len(edges)!=n-1:return False
        dist = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for n1,n2 in edges:
            dist[n1].append(n2)
            dist[n2].append(n1)
        visited=set()
        queue=collections.deque([0])
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            visited.add(node)
            for related in dist[node]:
                if related not in visited:
                    visited.add(related)
                    queue.append(related)
        return len(visited)==n
```
# BigO
Build graph will take O(n) and traversal all number will take O(n). In total is O(2n) where n is the given as the size of the index.
