# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array (Python)

## Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Heap" target="_blank"> Heap</a>.

## Description
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

## Sample I/O

### Example 1

```
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
```

### Example 2

```
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
```
## Note
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

## Methodology
The question is very simple and It marked as medium. So Here are two of solutions are acceptable. One is using sort library from python another one is using heap both are O(nlogn) time complexity.

Solution one is using sort and sort the input in descending order and the kth largest elemenet will be the k-1. Python using timesort which time complexity is O(nlogn).

Second solution is general. You can build a heap from input array and pop the heap until there k element left. Building heap is taking O(nlogn) time complexity.

Solution 1:

``` python
def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        res = sorted(nums, reverse=True)
        return res[k-1]
```

# BigO
Time complexity : O(nlogn) where n is the size of input


Solution 2:

``` python
def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heapq.heapify(nums)
        amount = len(nums)
        while amount > k:
            heapq.heappop(nums)
            amount -= 1
        return nums[0]
```

# BigO
Time complexity : O(nlogn) where n is the size of input
