# 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix (Python)

## Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Heap" target="_blank"> Heap</a>.

## Description
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

## Sample I/O

### Example 1

```
matrix = [
   [ 1,  5,  9],
   [10, 11, 13],
   [12, 13, 15]
],
k = 8,

return 13.
```

## Note
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ n2.

## Methodology
Use Heap to solve the question.

Min Heap (easy understand):
Push all values into min heap and pop k-1 value from min heap, then the head of the heap will be the kth element.

Max Heap (better perfermance):
Push values into max heap and keep the max heap length equal to k, then the head of the heap will be the kth element.

Min Heap Solution:

``` python
def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        minHeap = []
        for x in matrix:
            for y in x:
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, y)
        index = 0
        while index<k-1:
            heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            index+=1
        return minHeap[0]
```

# BigO
Time complexity : O($n^2$logn + klogk) where n is the size of input and k is the size of the kth largest element. Sum up to O($n^2$logn)


Max Heap Solution:

``` python
def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        maxHeap = []
        for x in matrix:
            for y in x:
                if len(maxHeap)<k:
                    heapq.heappush(maxHeap, -y)
                else:
                    heapq.heappushpop(maxHeap, -y)
        return -maxHeap[0]
```
