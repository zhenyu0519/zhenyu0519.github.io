# Leetcode 872. Leaf-Similar Trees (Python)

## Related Topic

<a href="/categories/#Tree" target="_blank"> Tree</a>.

## Description

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

[!tree](../../images/blog/tree.png)

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

## Constraints:

* Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 200 nodes.
* Both of the given trees will have values between 0 and 200


## Methodology
Use DFS to find both trees' leaf and append the leaf into array. Compare two arrays if they are equal then two trees are leaf-similar otherwise return false

## Code
```python
def leafSimilar(self, root1: TreeNode, root2: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def findLeaf(root, leaf_seq):
            if not root: return
            if not root.left and not root.right:
                leaf_seq.append(root.val)
            findLeaf(root.left, leaf_seq)
            findLeaf(root.right, leaf_seq)
            return leaf_seq
        root1_leaf=findLeaf(root1, [])
        root2_leaf=findLeaf(root2, [])
        return root1_leaf == root2_leaf
```
## BigO
Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of the nodes of both trees.
