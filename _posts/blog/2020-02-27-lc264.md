# Leetcode 264. Ugly Number II (Python)

# Related Topic

# Description
Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

## Sample I/O
### Example 1
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

# Methodology
This question can be solved by Dynamic Programming. However, dp is not the best solution.

let's start from the array of ugly numbers which contains just one number - 1. Let's use three pointers i2, i3, i5 to mark the last ugly number which was multiplied by 2, 3 and 5, correspondingly. 

The algorithm is straightforward: choose the smallest ugly number among 2\*nums[i2], 3\*nums[i3], 5\*nums[i5] and add it into the array. Move the corresponding pointer by one step. Repeat till you'll have 1690 ugly numbers.


# Code 1
```python
def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [1] * (n+1)
        index2, index3, index5 = 1, 1, 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = min(2 * dp[index2], 3 * dp[index3], 5 * dp[index5])
            if dp[i] == 2 * dp[index2]: index2 += 1
            if dp[i] == 3 * dp[index3]: index3 += 1
            if dp[i] == 5 * dp[index5]: index5 += 1
        return dp[-1]
```

# BigO
O(1) to retrieve preliminary computed ugly number, and about 1690 x times 5 = 84501690×5=8450 operations for preliminary computations.
