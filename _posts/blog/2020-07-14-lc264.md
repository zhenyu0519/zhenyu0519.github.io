# 264. Ugly Number II (Python)

## Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Dynamic-Programming" target="_blank"> Dynamic-Programming</a>.

## Description
Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.

## Sample I/O

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```


## Note:
1. 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
2. n does not exceed 1690.

## Methodology
Use Dynamic Programming. Since every ugly number is from one of previous ugly number time 2 or 3 or 5. We need i2, i3 and i5 three pointers to point the three ugly numbers from previous ugly numbers that times 2, 3, 5. We iterate the ugly number list and we want to find the min(i2 x 2, i3 x 3 and i5 x 5) this will give us the current ugly number for index i. The if the current ugly number is from 2 x i2 then we update i2, if it is from 3 x i3 we update i3 and if it is from 5 x i5 then we update i5.

``` python
def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [1] * (n+1)
        index2, index3, index5 = 1, 1, 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = min(2 * dp[index2], 3 * dp[index3], 5 * dp[index5])
            if dp[i] == 2 * dp[index2]: index2 += 1
            if dp[i] == 3 * dp[index3]: index3 += 1
            if dp[i] == 5 * dp[index5]: index5 += 1
        return dp[-1]
```

# BigO
Time complexity : O(1) to retrieve preliminary computed ugly number, and about 1690 x 5 = 84501690 × 5 = 8450 operations for preliminary computations.
