# Leetcode 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers (Python)

# Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Depth-First-Search" target="_blank"> Depth-First-Search</a>.

# Description
Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

## Sample I/O

### Example 1
```
Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

## Note
A leaf is a node with no children.

# Methodology
Use DFS to traversal the tree until reach the leaves. Each time you reach to a new node add current root value to previous value and multiple 10. When reach the leaves, append the cumulation to the res list, then return sum of the list

# Code(DFS)
```python
def sumNumbers(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        res = 0
        arr = []
        def dfs(root, res):
            if root is None: return
            if not root.left and not root.right:
                arr.append(res+root.val)
                return
            dfs(root.left, (res+root.val)*10)
            dfs(root.right, (res+root.val)*10)
        dfs(root, res)
        return sum(arr)
```
# BigO
We traversal all elements of the tree once so total time complexity is O(n)
