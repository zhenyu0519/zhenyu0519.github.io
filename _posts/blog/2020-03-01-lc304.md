# Leetcode 304. Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable (Python)

# Related Topic

# Description
Given a 2D matrix matrix, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).

[!image](../../images/blog/range_sum_query_2d.png)

The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = (2, 1) and (row2, col2) = (4, 3), which contains sum = 8.

## Sample I/O
### Example 1
```
The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = (2, 1) and (row2, col2) = (4, 3), which contains sum = 8.

```

## Note
* You may assume that the matrix does not change.
* There are many calls to sumRegion function.
* You may assume that row1 ≤ row2 and col1 ≤ col2.

# Methodology
This question can be sovled as "getting the intersection of set in math"

For example:
[!image](../../images/blog/range_sum_query_2d_sum.png)

To get the sum of area D, get the **Whole Area sum of area A,B,C,D** first. **Then Whole Area - B - C + A because area B and area C both include A**.

1. Find the base case:
   
Create a 2D dp list and init all elements of the first row and first column to 0
   

2. Find the pattern:
   
The area D = Then Whole Area - area B - area C + area A because area B and area C both include A

3. Answer:
   
The area D
   

# Code
```python
class NumMatrix:

    def __init__(self, matrix: List[List[int]]):
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]: return None
        row = len(matrix)
        col = len(matrix[0])
        self.dp = [[0]*(col+1) for _ in range(row+1)]
        for i in range(1,row+1):
            for j in range(1,col+1):
                self.dp[i][j]=self.dp[i][j-1]+self.dp[i-1][j]-self.dp[i-1][j-1]+matrix[i-1][j-1]
    def sumRegion(self, row1: int, col1: int, row2: int, col2: int) -> int:
        return self.dp[row2+1][col2+1]-self.dp[row2+1][col1]-self.dp[row1][col2+1]+self.dp[row1][col1]
```

# BigO
Then iterate 2D dp lists, it will cost O(m\*n). m is size of row and n is size of column. To get the sum of the region will cost O(1) so total is O(m\*n+1)
