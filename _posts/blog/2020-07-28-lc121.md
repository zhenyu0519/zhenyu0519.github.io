# Leetcode 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Python)

# Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Greedy" target="_blank"> Greedy</a>.

# Description
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
```
F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
```
Given N, calculate F(N).

## Sample I/O
### Example 1
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

# Methodology
max_profit = max_sell - min_buy. use greedy here to compare each price and min_price to update the min_price. Find the profit by substracting price to min_price and compare the profit to max_profit. As result we return the max_profit.


# Code

```python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        min_buy = float('inf')
        for price in prices:
            min_buy=min(min_buy, price)
            max_profit=max(max_profit, price-min_buy)
        return max_profit
```

# BigO
Time complexity : O(n)O(n). Only a single pass is needed.
