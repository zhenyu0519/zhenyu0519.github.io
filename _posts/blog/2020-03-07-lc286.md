# Leetcode 286. Walls and Gates (Python)

# Related Topic
<a href="/categories/#Depth-First-Search" target="_blank"> Depth-First-Search</a>.

# Description
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

1. -1 - A wall or an obstacle.
2. 0 - A gate.
3. INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.


## Sample I/O
### Example 1
Given the 2D grid:
```
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
```
After running your function, the board should be:

### Example 2
```
3  -1   0   1
2   2   1  -1
1  -1   2  -1
0  -1   3   4
```

# Methodology
This question can be solved by Depth First Search and It is similar with question<a href="/2020/03/06/lc200/" target="_blank">

To find the neareast distance to the gate of each empty cell, we can start from the gate and use dfs to walk through each reachable cell. This will also give the distance for the current cell to the current gate. If there is another gate, we will use the dfs again to walk through each empty cell again and if the current cell's distance is more close to the current gate, then we update the distance for the current cell.

# Code
```python
def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify rooms in-place instead.
        """
        if not rooms:
            return []
        row = len(rooms)
        col = len(rooms[0])
        directions=[(-1,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1)]
        def dfs(x,y,dis):
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x+dx, y+dy
                if 0<=nx<row and 0<=ny<col and rooms[nx][ny]>rooms[x][y]:
                    print(nx,ny)
                    rooms[nx][ny]=dis+1
                    dfs(nx,ny,dis+1)
        
        for x in range(row):
            for y in range(col):
                if rooms[x][y] == 0:
                    dfs(x,y,0)
```
# BigO
We iterate each cell will cost O(m\*n) where m\*n is the size of the 2D list. Each cell will also iterate four directions O(m\*n\*4). In total O(4\*m\*n)
